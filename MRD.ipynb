        "[Bajari et al. (2023)](https://www.amazon.science/publications/experimental-design-in-marketplaces) discuss a business scenario involving a video streaming service where viewers watch content provided by various content creators. The company is interested in understanding the impact of increasing the number of advertisements shown before the content begins (referred to as Pre-Roll Ads or PRAs) on the time viewers spend watching the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The specific business problem is to assess the effect of doubling the number of PRAs (from one to two) on the engagement of viewers with content creators. The company needs to determine whether increasing the number of PRAs will reduce viewer engagement and how content creators might react to this change, particularly in terms of adjusting the number of ads shown during the content (Mid-Roll Ads or MRAs). You can refer to the paper for more details on MRAs and PRAs.\n",

This effect is captured by a \"dispersion\" parameter, $\\delta > 0$. This triggers an indirect response from content creators: as a result of the viewers' dispersion, some content creators may choose to reduce their MRAs to lessen the impact of the increased PRAs. This response is captured by a \"premium\" parameter, $\\alpha > 0$."
